    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This SRFI defines a version of
      the <code>define-record-type</code> definition
      of <code>R<sup>6</sup>RS</code>
      and <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-237/">SRFI
      237</a> that extends the <code>define-record-type</code> syntax
      of <code>R<sup>7</sup>RS</code>, reconciling both systems.</p>

    <p>This SRFI is meant to be adopted by R<sup>7</sup>RS-large to
      integrate essentially the R<sup>6</sup>RS record system
      compatibly with the existing R<sup>7</sup>RS-small record
      system.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>There have been requests to extend the <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/">SRFI 9</a>-syntax
	  of <code>define-record-type</code> to bring it feature-wise
	  on par with the R<sup>6</sup>RS syntax.  At the moment, it
	  is unclear how to do this so that non-default constructors
	  can be specified in a way that naturally embraces the idea
	  of the SRFI 9 syntax.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>In contrast to R<sup>6</sup>RS, the Scheme standard
      R<sup>7</sup>RS does not yet have record types that can be
      extended via single inheritance, can be defined procedurally, or
      can be inspected.  Several proposals, including <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-99/">SRFI 99</a>, SRFI
      131, <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-136/">SRFI 136</a>, and <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-150/">SRFI 150</a>, have been made to add such record
      types to R<sup>7</sup>RS.  Each of these proposals, however, is
      lacking in at least one of the following areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed syntax and/or semantics are new and untested in
          the large.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed semantics are not compatible with
          R<sup>7</sup>RS field names interpreted as (hygienic)
          identifiers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The proposed semantics are not reconciled with
          R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This SRFI therefore proposes adoption of the established and
      widely used R<sup>6</sup>RS record system for R<sup>7</sup>RS.
      For this, the <code>define-record-type</code> form of R<sup>7</sup>RS is extended (see below).</p>

    <p>The advantages of this proposal include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>R<sup>7</sup>RS gets a record-type facility as powerful
          as the R<sup>6</sup>RS record-type facility, including
          single inheritance, a procedural interface, and
          inspection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Porting code and sharing specifications between R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS is simplified.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Scheme systems supporting both R<sup>6</sup>RS and
          R<sup>7</sup>RS need only one implementation of record types.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In principle, the proposal works with the SRFI 9 record
          field names interpreted as identifiers or as symbols.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The record-type facility is known and tested in the large.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Note:</i> Objections against the R<sup>6</sup>RS record
      system were were voiced by people voting against ratification of
      that standard's latest candidate draft.  These objections
      touched the complexity, the role of the procedural layer, and
      the compatibility between the syntactic and the procedural layer
      of the R<sup>6</sup>RS record system.  These objections can be addressed as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>While the complexity of the record system would have
          exceeded the scope and size of R<sup>7</sup>RS-small, it
          fits the scope and size of R<sup>7</sup>RS-large.  Moreover,
          the refinements of SRFI 237 simplify the use of the
          R<sup>6</sup>RS record-type facility.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The procedural layer is intended to be used when record
          types have to be constructed at runtime, e.g. by
          interpreters that need to construct host-compatible record
          types.  The procedural layer, much like the inspection layer,
          is therefore not needed for most code.  Therefore, the vast
          majority of programmers can ignore the procedural layer.</p>
	<p>This is strengthened by SRFI 237, which
	  removes the restriction that the syntactic layer can only define
	  one constructor per record type defined.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The syntactic and the procedural layer are compatible, and a
          syntactically defined record type can inherit from a
          procedurally defined record type, and vice versa.  Whether a
          record type has been defined syntactically or procedurally
          is generally unobservable.  To inherit from a record type,
          all that has to be exposed from it is either the (bound)
          record name or the record type descriptor (with or without a
          record constructor descriptor).</p>

	<p>The latter is even simplified by SRFI 237 as the latter
	  three entities can be used effectively interchangeably.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>Both of the following record type definitions are allowed with
    the syntax provided by this SRFI, and are equivalent:</p>

    <pre>(define-record-type foo
  (make-foo x)
  foo?
  (x foo-x)
  (y foo-y foo-set-y!))</pre>

    <pre>(define-record-type (foo make-foo foo?)
  (fields (immutable x foo-x)
          (mutable y foo-y foo-set-y!))
  (protocol
    (lambda (new)
      (lambda (x)
        (new x (if #f #f))))))</pre>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <p>The syntax is exported by the R<sup>6</sup>RS
      libraries <code>(srfi :240)</code> and <code>(srfi :240
	define-record-type)</code>, and by the R<sup>7</sup>RS
      library <code>(srfi 240)</code>.</p>

    <p>An R<sup>7</sup>RS system supporting this SRFI should provide
      the <code>define-record-type</code> syntax also in
      the <code>(scheme base)</code> library.  In this case, the
      feature identifier <code>srfi-240</code> should be provided.</p>

    <p>The record mechanism described in this SRFI is based on the
      record mechanism described in SRFI 237, which, in turn, is based
      on the record mechanism of R<sup>6</sup>RS.  Unless said
      otherwise, definitions and semantics remain unchanged from SRFI
      237.</p>

    <p>The libraries exports the auxiliary
      syntax <code>fields</code>, <code>mutable</code>, <code>immutable</code>, <code>parent</code>, <code>protocol</code>, <code>sealed</code>, <code>opaque</code>, <code>nongenerative</code>, <code>parent-rtd</code> and <code>generative</code>
      identical to the exports by the same name of <code>(srfi :237 records)</code>.

    <p><code>(define-record-type &lang;name spec&rang; &lang;record clause&rang; &hellip;)</code></p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i> This syntax is equivalent to the syntax of the
      record-type-defining form <code>define-record-type</code>
      exported by <code>(srfi :237 records)</code>.</p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i>
      This definition is equivalent to the record-type-defining
      form <code>define-record-type</code> exported by <code>(srfi :237 records)</code>.</p>

    <p><code>(define-record-type &lang;name&rang;
        (&lang;constructor name&rang; &lang;field name&rang; &hellip;)
        &lang;pred&rang; &lang;field&rang; &hellip;)</code></p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i>
      <code>&lang;Name&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;constructor
      name&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;pred&rang;</code> are
      identifiers, each <code>&lang;field&rang;</code> is of the
      form <code>(&lang;field name&rang; &lang;accessor
      name&rang;)</code> or <code>(&lang;field name&rang;
      &lang;accessor name&rang; &lang;mutator name&rang;)</code>, and
      all <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code>, <code>&lang;accessor
      names&rang;</code> and <code>&lang;mutator names&rang;</code>
      are identifiers.</p>

    <p>It is an error for the same identifier to occur more than once
      as a field name.</p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i> A new non-sealed, non-opaque and generative
      base record type is generated, and the form expands into a set
      of definitions in the environment where
      the <code>define-record-type</code> form appears.</p>

    <p>The record type has as many fields as there
      are <code>&lang;fields&rang;</code>, with the
      given <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code>, in that order.
      Each <code>&lang;field&rang;</code>, if of the first form, defines
      an immutable field, and a mutable <code>&lang;field&rang;</code> otherwise.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Name&rang;</code> is defined by this definition to
      the (bound) record name of the record type.  If this record
      name is used in the <code>parent</code> clause of
      another <code>define-record-type</code> definition, it is an
      error if that <code>define-record-type</code> definition specifies no <code>protocol</code> clause.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Constructor name&rang;</code> is bound by the
      definition to a constructor for the defined record type.  The
      constructor takes as many arguments as there
      are <code>&lang;field names&rang;</code> listed
      with <code>&lang;constructor name&rang;</code>.  When the
      constructor is invoked, fields of the new created record whose
      names are listed with <code>&lang;constructor name&rang;</code>
      take their (initial) values from the corresponding actual
      arguments.  The (initial) values of all other fields of the newly
      created record are unspecified.

    <p>It is an error for a field name
      to be listed with <code>&lang;constructor name&rang;</code> but
      not as a field name of a field.</p>

    <p><code>&lang;Predicate&rang;</code> is bound by the definition
    to a predicate for the defined record type.</p>

    <p>The <code>&lang;accessor names&rang;</code>
      and <code>&lang;mutator names&rang;</code> are bound by the
      definition to the accessors and mutators, respectively, of the
      corresponding fields.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>The following example program runs without an error.</p>

    <pre>(import (rnrs base (6))
        (except (srfi :237 records) define-record-type)
	(srfi :240 define-record-type))

(define-record-type foo
  (make-foo x)
  foo?
  (x foo-x)
  (y foo-y foo-set-y!))

(assert (equal? #t (foo? (make-foo 1))))

(assert (equal? 2 (foo-x (make-foo 2))))

(assert (equal? '(3 4) (let ((foo (make-foo 3)))
                         (foo-set-y! foo 4)
                         (list (foo-x foo) (foo-y foo)))))

(define rtd (record-type-descriptor foo))
(define rcd (record-constructor-descriptor foo))

(assert (equal? 'foo (record-type-name rtd)))

(assert (not (record-type-parent rtd)))

(assert (record-type-generative? rtd))

(assert (not (record-type-sealed? rtd)))

(assert (not (record-type-opaque? rtd)))

(assert (equal? '#(x y) (record-type-field-names rtd)))

(assert (not (record-field-mutable? rtd 0)))

(assert (record-field-mutable? rtd 1))

(assert rcd)

(define-record-type bar
  (parent foo)
  (fields z)
  (protocol
   (lambda (n)
     (lambda (x z)
       ((n x) z)))))

(assert (foo? (make-bar 5 6)))
(assert (equal? 5 (foo-x (make-bar 5 6))))
(assert (equal? 6 (bar-z (make-bar 5 6))))
(assert (equal? 7 (let ([bar (make-bar 5 6)])
                    (foo-set-y! bar 7)
                    (foo-y bar))))</pre>

    <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>The Larceny Scheme implementation pioneered the idea of
      a <code>define-record-type</code> form that unites the syntax of
      R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS.</p>

    <p>The foundations of the record facility described here come from
      R<sup>6</sup>RS.  This SRFI reuses language from R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>
